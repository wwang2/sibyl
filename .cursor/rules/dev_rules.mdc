Philosophy
	Simplicity > Features > Performance (unless a benchmark proves otherwise).
	Every change must delete or simplify something elsewhere.
	No dead files. If it’s unused, remove it (or add a test/reference proving why it stays).
	Typed, tested, formatted, linted before commit.
	No secrets in code. Use env vars or a vault. Never upload real keys.

File & Folder Hygiene
	Delete unreferenced files (code, assets, schemas, migrations, notebooks) as soon as they’re unused.
	Prohibited names: *_v2.py, final_final.*, copy_of_*. Use proper version control.
	Co-locate code with its tests: foo.py ↔ tests/test_foo.py.
	Keep module depth shallow (ideally ≤ 3 levels).
	
Environment management
	timely update configuration such as requriements.txt when a new dependency is introduced.
	Always remember activate the environment to run any code.
	Do not hard code file path!

Credential management
	Never commit or paste secrets, tokens, API keys.

Temporary Workflows
	Scratch or experimental code must live in /experiments or /temp_scripts and be auto-cleaned weekly (delete or promote to production).
	Any file under /tmp, /experiments or /temp_scripts, or with suffix .temp, .draft, .bak is unmergeable.Philosophy
	Simplicity > Features > Performance (unless proven otherwise).
	Fewer files, fewer concepts, fewer dependencies.
	If a change adds complexity, it must remove at least as much elsewhere.

# Git Commit & Push Rules

Commits
  - Commit small, one logical change at a time.
  - Use imperative messages: <type>(<scope>): <summary>.
  - Types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, style, test, chore.
  - Do not commit secrets, large data, or temp files.

Push
  - Always pull --rebase before push.
  - Run tests/linters before push.
  - No direct pushes to main/master; use feature branches + PRs.

Branching
  - main: stable/deployable only.
  - dev: integration.
  - feature/*: new work, delete after merge.

History
  - Don’t rewrite shared branch history.
  - Force-push only on personal feature branches.
