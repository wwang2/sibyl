Philosophy
	•	Simplicity > Features > Performance (unless proven otherwise).
	•	Fewer files, fewer concepts, fewer dependencies.
	•	If a change adds complexity, it must remove at least as much elsewhere.

File & Folder Hygiene
	•	Delete unused files (code, assets, schemas, migrations, notebooks) as soon as they’re unreferenced. 

Temporary Workflows
	•	Scratch or experimental code must live in /experiments and be auto-cleaned weekly (delete or promote to production).
	•	Any file under /tmp, /experiments, or with suffix .temp, .draft, .bak is unmergeable.Philosophy
