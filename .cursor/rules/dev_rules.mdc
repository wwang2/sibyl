Philosophy
	Simplicity > Features > Performance (unless proven otherwise).
	Fewer files, fewer concepts, fewer dependencies.
	If a change adds complexity, it must remove at least as much elsewhere.

File & Folder Hygiene
	Delete unused files (code, assets, schemas, migrations, notebooks) as soon as theyâ€™re unreferenced. 
	avoid file name like *_v2.py when versioning is not needed.

Environment management
	timely update configuration such as requriements.txt when a new dependency is introduced.
	Always remember activate the environment to run any code.

Temporary Workflows
	Scratch or experimental code must live in /experiments or /temp_scripts and be auto-cleaned weekly (delete or promote to production).
	Any file under /tmp, /experiments or /temp_scripts, or with suffix .temp, .draft, .bak is unmergeable.Philosophy
